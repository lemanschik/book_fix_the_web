# a Collection of Issue comments 
I need to say it was maybe not the best format but it helped me to brainstorm and test my ideas fast. 

There where 2 main Results and Outcomes:

- They do not understand.
- They do not agree.

But the Math is simple so the question is what is blocking the transport of the facts. Does it make to much fun to code a Framework?
That sounds like a bad question right but no it is not in fact it is maybe what is the main blocker. It is to Attractive to code a own framework
release it and get github starts. People will more likly accept something called a Framework then learning the fundamentals. No Matter how easyy
or fast and error free the results of the fundamentals are. They want to write the next Framework and call it something.
