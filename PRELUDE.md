## Why the Web needs Fixing?


## How can the Web look like?


## Why did we do all that if it was that bad?
To understand the root cause you need to understand a bit of the history of computing the amount of developers explodes and doubles fast
that leads to a leak of Information that gets Transported from Old Expirenced to Young Fresh Coders. 

The Complexity Matrix of even a Smaller Software Project Stack lets take any SaaS Project which is a common buissnes model today has a Stack Complexity
that is mind blowing and it takes tons of man years to handle that correct. It does not look like that because you can find tutorials around the web
which allow you to install and deploy maybe something with in a minute but you will not know what it does at the core and what that means to the system.

that problem again gets abstracted by libcontainer and other isolation zero trust concepts. Lets name it when we call something good it is always a solution to 
a existing technical dept. We stoped elemenating the root cause while it would be easy possible today.

The core problem remains how do we fix the web? We need to write books like this one and start spread the word and concept. 

We need to abstract the obvios and keep the meaningful. 

Also we need a Mindset change many projects depend and force us into a domain related model of development and interaction that leads to none needed
overhead for us all. For example we could throw away over 50% when not even much more of over 50 mio Open Source Projects. You can Easy discover that your self.

Look into packages packaging got complex today look into module systems and resolutions and build tools you will find a lot of stuff and adapter over adapter
lets talk compiler slang the mother of all compiler optimizations is the so called Inlineing it takes a function and puts all needed references into it directly so no additional
lookup is required. That speeds up the function on re execution. 

The old standard JVM default for that was depth 8 and it worked today the ~depth seen in a relativ small hello world of a framework is ~60 deep then it touches your 
Code the print Hello World.

if that is not shooking you then you can stop reading and move on with your life.
